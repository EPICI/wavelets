Open source DAW. Creativity shouldn't have a price.

Still very early. I'm currently building the framework and haven't made my plans public, but that doesn't mean you can't try to help out. 
Besides, eventually, probably around when I finish, I'll hit my skill cap and until I learn more development will halt without contributors.
I know, the source code is a mess since I usually don't bother removing debug code. Also Node and Nodes will get confused a lot. It's a ripoff of Blender's, controlled by some kind of scripting language rather than a nice UI.
