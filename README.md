Open source DAW. Creative expression shouldn't have a price.

Right now it's far from finished, so this message here is for anyone that might want to contribute rather than the future users. The development team is small (one person actually) so progress is slow. It's important to not push goals ahead, or it'll never be done - v1 was sort of a test run, v2 (the current) is targeting a usable state, a possible v3 would compete with other programs.
Coming much later than Blender and other open source projects, we learn some things - we want flexibility, but not at the cost of ease of use. We should expose a simple and intuitive UI, including more advanced options only when justified. For example, bezier splines will be good enough for most use cases, and if you need more you should make it yourself.
The notions of OOP, nodes, and hooks go well together. Optimally we'd have total freedom and could plug anything into anything else (and somehow retain performance), but it makes it a nightmare to program and the UI gets clunky.
